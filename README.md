# UCFTP - Unidirectional Control and File Transfer Protocol

## Directory structure

- `ucftp_sender` - sender CLI implementation
- `ucftp_receiver` - receiver daemon implementation
- `ucftp_shared` - code used in both sender and receiver

## Encryption keys

Sender and receiver both have an asymmetric keypair. Keys are expected in PEM format as generated by OpenSSL. They can be generated using commands:

- private key: `openssl genpkey -algorithm x25519 -out sk.pem`
- public key corresponding to `private_key.pem`: `openssl pkey -in sk.pem -out pk.pem`
